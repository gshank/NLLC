For the younger kids we will try to do some very focused work in the beginning of class but then the rest of the time will be not as structured for them, depending on their attention span. It would be fine if the younger ones to play some so long as they don't interupt the lesson for the older kids.

For the older kids it would be great if they could stay focused on the dancing for the whole hour.
