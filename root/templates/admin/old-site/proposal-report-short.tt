		   <p><strong>Program Name:</strong> MON 1] Creative Writing Workshop</p><p><strong>Days and Times:</strong> <br />Mondays 10:00-11:30</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> <br />This is an affirming, confidence-building and skill- developing workshop. Everyone has stories to tell or things to say so writers of all experience levels are welcome, even those who have never tried creative writing. We'll learn to write our best by learning what is best in our writing. By building upon strengths, rather than just trying to eliminate weaknesses, writers can become more confident in their work and more enthusiastic about writing. 

Each meeting will be divided into 2-4 segments of writing, listening and responding. I'll have items or ideas that will be a starting point for writing. These items may spark memories, stimulate creative thought, or both. For instance, I may bring in bags of cinnamon for everyone to smell, chocolates for everyone to taste or sandpaper for everyone to touch. In one activity I pass out a list of quotes and ask participants to find one that inspires them as a starting point. For 20 minutes we'll write on these ideas. At the end of 20 minutes I'll invite volunteers to read what they have written. No one will ever be required to read, it is strictly voluntary. Then others in the class will offer positive feedback. Only positive, no negatives allowed. I'll ask questions like what do you remember, what did you like, what surprised you, to encourage responses. After everyone who wants to read has done so we'll move on the next period of writing, reading, reflecting. There will also be time to talk about genres, how best to preserve our writings, and publishing opportunities.

The classes are meant to be fun, relaxed, and both physically and emotionally safe for everyone. 

This Creative Writing Workshop is based on the Amherst Writers and Artists creative writing workshops. </p><p><strong>Leader and Co-Leaders:</strong> <br />Julie Humphrey</p><p><strong>Leader Bio:</strong> <br />I studied under Pat Schneider, the founder of Amherst Writers and Artists. In the past 8 years I've lead this Creative Writing Workshop for adults, for adults in crisis, for children in a homeschooling co-op and for Creative Arts Camps. </p><p><strong>Location Requirements:</strong> <br />Conference Room</p><p><strong>Children Requirements:</strong> <br />Ages 12 and up. Young writers of all skill levels are welcome to attend. Participants should be able to listen quietly to the writings of others. There's a also a need for silence during the 5-20 minute intervals of writing. There will be a need to commit to offering only positive feedback and never making fun of the writings of others, even if those others are your friends. </p><p><strong>Min Students:</strong> 4 <strong>Max Students:</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Sessions:</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Program Time:</strong> 1 hour 30 minutes</p><p><strong>One Session?:</strong> Attendance is flexible, but regular attendance does help to build community.</p><p><strong>Materials Fee:</strong> none</p><p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> <br />Notebooks and pencils or pens
It's also critical that I have a list of allergies and dietary restrictions at the first meeting so I can prepare alternative activities where needed.</p>		   </div>

Parents are encouraged to stay in the gym (and can potentially be helpful scribes if that is wanted by any student) but are not required to do so. Students should be mature and able to take care of expensive equipment and not so easily replaced supplies. They should also capable of putting together, or learning to put together, a show (writing not required, shows can be "written" on a computer or dictated to somebody else) with help from the instructor.

Having parents who are willing stay in the gym would be great. Having parents be assistants, helping as scribes for those who don't like to physically write, or with research, or for participants to bounce ideas off of, will be encouraged (though not strictly required). If there are other adults willing to be part of this I'm very open to that.</p>		   </div>

If a student thinks they can participate with this expectation, and is comfortable with their fine motor skills (beads thread and needle are SMALL) then I definitely have some skills to pass on. I will bring some examples of my work to every class as reference. We will start with a small piece, such as a bracelet or earrings, but the only limit to where you go is your imagination and patience. I have some beads that can be used, but speaking for myself a bunch of the fun comes from picking the colors of my palette as an expression of myself. I encourage you to browse the seed beads in the store on the commons if you don't have any already. Sizes 11 or 12 are good to start with. I will shop for needles and thread as I have found some better than others, at most reimbursement will be $2. </p><p><strong>Leader and Co-Leaders:</strong> <br />Inge Johnson</p><p><strong>Leader Bio:</strong> <br />I learned to seed bead at age 16, when I was 18 I traveled out West and supported my self by selling my jewelry.

We will begin with reels and gigs and depending on how fast we as a class progress we might move on to slip gigs.  This class will have varying skill levels that will break into maybe 3 different groups of four to eight participants. One hope would be to maybe perform one or two of the dances for the Northern Lights community. But whether or not a performance springs from the class, just dancing can be so much fun, and we'll be dancing to some really toe tapping, thigh slapping, cool Irish music.</p><p><strong>Leader and Co-Leaders:</strong> <br />Nora De Mott Grady,  Rosie Grady Sayvetz, Ellen Grady</p><p><strong>Location Requirements:</strong> <br />Gym</p><p><strong>Children Requirements:</strong> <br />For ages 5 and up.

For the younger kids we will try to do some very focused work in the beginning of class but then the rest of the time will be not as structured for them, depending on their attention span. It would be fine if the younger ones to play some so long as they don't interupt the lesson for the older kids.

For the older kids it would be great if they could stay focused on the dancing for the whole hour.

In the end the hope would be to bring the whole class together to do the dances .</p><p><strong>Min Students:</strong> 5 <strong>Max Students:</strong> 20</p><p><strong>Sessions:</strong> 7</p><p><strong>Program Time:</strong> 1 hour</p><p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> <br />Wear comfortable clothes and if you have ballet slippers or step dancing slippers that would be great but not required...sox will be fine too.</p>		   </div>

This is an immersion-style course, which will introduce children to the French language through the use of games, songs, arts and crafts, and movement exercises. Material will be presented theatrically, with the use of colorful visual aids and props, so that students maintain a comfortable level of comprehension. We will cover "every day" topics in French, beginning with salutations, colors, and numbers, and working our way through the language, expanding on vocabulary to topics such as weather, sports, the home, cuisine, and more! Each session will include three elements: the instructors presentation of the material, an art activity, and movement exercises, which include various games and songs. Students of all levels of French comprehension are welcome. This course may be taken multiple times, as repetition is key in second language-acquisition. Parent participation is highly recommended, but not required. Come be part of the fun and surprise yourself with how much French you can already understand!</p><p><strong>Leader and Co-Leaders:</strong> <br />Instructor: Jessie Wasserman; Coordinator: Melissa Foree</p><p><strong>Leader Bio:</strong> <br />Jessie Wasserman holds a B.A. in French Studies and a minor in Theater Arts from Ithaca College.

She is a lover of foreign languages and performing arts, and finds that second language acquisition is most desirable at an early age. Variety, creativity, and equality are essential elements in Miss Wassermans pedagogy. She is a strong supporter of kinesthetic learning who enjoys the incorporation of movement, song, and dance into the classroom in order to increase comprehension. She also understands that the educational experience can be challenging and frustrating for many students. Her goal is to minimize the factors that restrict and discourage students by integrating a variety of exercises and activities that stimulate students and preserve their interests. She provides an equal-opportunity classroom and expects participation from all students.

Miss Wasserman has worked with children and students for most of her life, in a variety of settings.

This is an immersion-style course, intended to provide students with beginner French language and comprehension skills. During each weekly session, material will be presented to students along with the addition of handouts that are completed collectively during class and taken home to practice. Books, posters, and other visual aids will also be incorporated. During select sessions, students will learn song and movement exercises as well. The focus in this course is pronunciation, vocabulary, and comprehension. Material will range from basic salutations to more complex topics such as geography, time, weather expressions, and more. Each course builds upon the material from the previous week, and therefore, attendance is key. Student participation is a must! Parents are welcome to stay for class, yet not required. Come explore the beautiful French language!</p><p><strong>Leader and Co-Leaders:</strong> <br />Instructor: Jessie Wasserman; Coordinator: Melissa Foree</p><p><strong>Leader Bio:</strong> <br />Jessie Wasserman holds a B.A. in French Studies and a minor in Theater Arts from Ithaca College. She has spent time living, traveling and studying in Europe, specifically France and Italy. She is a lover of foreign languages and performing arts, and finds that second language acquisition is most desirable at an early age. Variety, creativity, and equality are essential elements in Miss Wassermans pedagogy. She is a strong supporter of kinesthetic learning who enjoys the incorporation of movement, song, and dance into the classroom in order to increase comprehension. She also understands that the educational experience can be challenging and frustrating for many students. Her goal is to minimize the factors that restrict and discourage students by integrating a variety of exercises and activities that stimulate students and preserve their interests. She provides an equal-opportunity classroom and expects participation from all students.

Miss Wasserman has worked with children and students for most of her life, in a variety of settings. Previously, she has been a Teachers Assistant for Beginner college-level French 101 and 102 and has also been the French Instructor for the Lingua Learning program through the Johnson School at Cornell (07) which is an immersion-style language program for children 2-10. Currently, she can be found substitute teaching in Lansing and Ithaca Public Schools. She has also been very active in theater and performing arts since a young age, and has worked on many productions, both on stage and on the production team. In the classroom, she combines her two passions, theater and foreign language, to create a fun, comfortable, and productive learning atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Location Requirements:</strong> <br />Gym</p><p><strong>Children Requirements:</strong> <br />Parent presence is not required.</p><p><strong>Min Students:</strong> 5 <strong>Max Students:</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Sessions:</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Program Time:</strong> 1 hour once a week</p><p><strong>One Session?:</strong> Regular attendance is preferred.</p><p><strong>Materials Fee:</strong> No materials fee, but there is an instructor's fee of approximately $48 for the 10 week session.</p>		   </div>

Each family comes to each meeting with food, props and activities which encourage this re-enactment.  Some meetings will be more structured and some less, depending on the book being read.  
All books read in this club will have been published 50 or more years ago.  Books for the Winter session will be 1. "Robinson Crusoe" by Daniel Defoe (pub.1719)  2.

		   <p><strong>Program Name:</strong> OTHER] Boat Building</p><p><strong>Days and Times:</strong> <br />To be decided; program is off site</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> <br />As a group we will immerse ourselves in the process of building a small wooden sail boat.  This will include planning, acquiring materials, possibly raising money for materials and tools, researching methods of woodworking.  We will read books that explain different methods of forming the wood, joining the wood, wood selection.
This class will last at least all year long and possibly into the next year.  The beginning stages will be a lot of reading and discussion, looking at the drawing plans (that I already have) and tool acquiring (talking to people about borrowing tools, possibly getting tool donation).
This class is for kids who are truly motivated by this challenge.  Their interest will need to carry them through the research stage, the problem solving stages and the money raising stage.
This will be very much a learn as you go, trial and error class.
I will schedule an early visit with Cayuga Wooden Boats to ask questions and see what boat building can look like.
I will gather interesting books that have the information we are looking for and help distribute them to the kids.  I will not spoon feed them the information.  We will be learning side by side.  I will lead the discussions and add some interesting things I've learned.  I am looking for the kids to share what they are learning with the group as well.

I would like to interview for the seats in this class.  The nature of this project requires forethought, interest and focus.  
</p><p><strong>Leader and Co-Leaders:</strong> <br />Crista Shopis
I would like a parent of one of the children involved to be the co-leader if possible.
This project will go as fast or as slow as the group of kids working on it wants it to go.</p><p><strong>Leader Bio:</strong> <br />I have limited carpentry skills and limited sailing skills.  I have worked on house building a little bit.  I have never built a boat before.  I have organized large scale community projects that have accomplished big things such as complete running water systems for entire towns.  
What I know is how to organize the elements of a project and juggle the pieces.  What I don't know is how to build a boat, so I will be learning along side the children.
I have two small children (6 and 8) who will likely want to help and I will likely try to find a way for them to do so.</p><p><strong>Location Requirements:</strong> <br />This class will happen at my house at 312 Lake Avenue (near the Gimme on Cayuga)</p><p><strong>Children Requirements:</strong> <br />11  and up</p><p><strong>Min Students:</strong> 2 <strong>Max Students:</strong> 4</p><p><strong>Sessions:</strong> 52</p><p><strong>Program Time:</strong> up to 4 hours</p><p><strong>One Session?:</strong> This class requires interest and dedication.
