----Jenn's requirements:

- Generate calendar and program listing from one datasource
- Ability to easily re-order the classes on the program listing (rather than
  the manual way I do it now)(by what fields? ...)
- Ability to preserve what people registered for but still able to use the
  system to create class and waiting lists (right now I make the lists
separately, just in a document because I don't want to erase what people
registered for and because I can't use the system to mark people as on the
waiting list)
- Ability to list class enrollees in different ways, including by how they
  ranked the class
- Ability to generate class lists by location
- Ability to shut down enrollment when the enrollment period closes
- Members can access their past program proposals so they will stop asking me
  to copy them over from term to term

-Members can enter and update their own contact information
